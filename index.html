    <h4 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer and the harmful effects of sleep deprivation</h4>
      <div class="post-content">
          <p>If somebody had told me a week ago that i would be able to make a <em>website</em>,i would not have believed them.
          As a medical student, it's difficult to balance studying with learning programming but so far,i believe my progress
          has been astounding.</p>
          This is my <strong><em>first</em></strong> project which is basically making a blog after a few lessons in programming.</p>
        <p>As a medical student, most times the harmful effects of sleep is not emphasized enough as most students
          tend to stay awake over night to cover the bulky syllabus which is understandable. I believe that with proper planning, a medical
          student can get enough sleep and still be able to cover their syllabus even though it's bulky. Due to this concern, i have decided
          to emphasize how important sleep is and what can happen to us if we don't get enough sleep. My fellow medical students, let us all
          remember that our health should always be our first priority. An interesting topic to read about is the harmful effects of sleep
          deprivation.Please click on the link, <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/886245">Medscape</a> for more information on the
          harmful effects of sleep deprivation.</p>
